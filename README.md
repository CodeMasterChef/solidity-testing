# Solidity Testing:
It is important for testing Solidity smart contracts before deploying them in to mainnet. Because the smart contract code is immutable.

Truffle uses the [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) testing framework and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) for assertions to provide you with a solid framework from which to write your JavaScript tests.

Example practises from homepage: https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/testing/writing-tests-in-javascript
# How to run:
## Compile smart contracts:
```bash
$ truffle compile

Compiling your contracts...
===========================
> Compiling ./contracts/Migrations.sol
> Compiling ./contracts/SimpleSmartContract.sol
> Artifacts written to /Users/macos/Code/CodeForFun/solidity-samples/solidity-testing/build/contracts
> Compiled successfully using:
   - solc: 0.8.0+commit.c7dfd78e.Emscripten.clang
```
## Deploy smart contracts:
```bash
$ truffle migrate

Compiling your contracts...
===========================
> Everything is up to date, there is nothing to compile.



Starting migrations...
======================
> Network name:    'development'
> Network id:      5777

  Contract: SimpleSmartContract

    âœ“ Should deploy smart contract properly


  1 passing (36ms)
```

# Some notes:

```javascript
const simpleSmartContract = await SimpleSmartContract.deployed();
```
deployed() DOES NOT deploy a contract by itself. It only return you a Javascript object pointing to an already deployed smart contract.

The files in `migrations` folder are used to defined what should be deployed.
